BUGS:

- undoing works for text choice input text text input and if inputs but is never
  reflected in ui

- do nothing (continue to next gather) choices are broken in player.

- Hitting tab inside the play view, hides the menu bar, rendering the app unusable.


- not really a bug (yet), but inside
  StoryNetView.js, search for this line:
      Object.values(state.pages).forEach(page => {
        and read the comment above it. This might (maybe?) lead to bugs if not fixed to use hooks(?)


- arrows not rendered if linked from gather. fix. or ... after page restart they are rendered
  but otherwise not? investigate.

-reset mouse cursor on page open

- undo sometimes still shows old stream content? maybe some load interference?

- second identical image on page is NOT RENDERED??????! IT'S there, but somehow empty????


###########################

priority VERY HIGH todo:

  - if conditions and variables inside story -> implement

  - runtime story: fix gather (throws errors sometimes and sometimes just doesn't gather)
      gathers work tentatively now, but have to be thouroughly tested with subpaths of subpaths, choices
      that do nothing etc.

  - runtime story: fix undo (has bugs)

  - fix page open/close bugs, page delete bugs (might be new, regression? was this a localstorage
  bug? weird. or a load/save bug. test load/save more)


priority HIGH:

  - if conditions for choices! (including equivalent ink export)

  - test with huge stories

  - manually test user interface for pain points, especially nested choices


priority PRETTY HIGH:

  - fix canvas story view bugs (expecially the one where thousand pages are created all of a sudden)


priority MEDIUM LOW:
  - status bar (inside story)


PRIORITY LOW:
  - assets (audio)
  - UI IMPROVEMENTS / CHANGES:
    - split up the story view into individual windows/panels/whatever
    - persistent decollapsing of choices
    - maybe: hot reload / playing pane on right hand side (probably lots of work)
        -> all radical UI CHANGES: not before the user ui has been tested

    - test page buttons with icons to test if interface becomes cleaner / if it achieves better usabiliy

PRIORITY VERY LOW:
  - timers
  - increase canvas size optionally
  - restart button on story end

done:
  - reload / save / undo (inside story)
  - assets (images)
  - fade transition
  - write meta data to html including title 
  - fix ink export: $variables should be converted to _variables and disallow vars starting with underscore
  - save story as json / load story as json (essential, goes without saying)
  - added icons for storynetview buttons
  - basic end story command
  - basic move command up and down

CODE SNIPPETS:

    perfect FOR READING JSON: is it though?
  function fileInputOnChange(ev) {
    console.log(ev, fileInput.current,)
    if (!fileInput.current.files) return
    let file =  fileInput.current.files[0]
    if (!file) return

    let reader = new FileReader()

    reader.onload = function (evt) {
      let content = evt.target.result
      loadContent(content)
      fileInput.current.value = "" //trick:
      //so if exact same file is selected twice,
      //it will still trigger as change
    }

    reader.onerror = function (evt) {
      alert("Loading failed.")
    }

    reader.readAsText(file, "UTF-8")

  }
